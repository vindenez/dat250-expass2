### Questions

* The database is stored in the DB.mv.db and DB.trace.db files.
  The used database is every entity class being a table in the database and relations between columns of tables is connected by the class variables.
  I believe it is used when EntityManager is called and the relations between classes is created.

* Hibernate:
  create table Customer (
  id bigint generated by default as identity,
  name varchar(255),
  primary key (id)
  )

* Changed false to true on this line in perstistence.xml: property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/
  The created tables did actually correspond to my initial thoughts regarding this exercise.

* The tests passes, but I couldnÂ´t get them to pass without changing Address.getOwners() and Bank.getOwningCards to return a set instead of a list.
