### Questions

* The database is stored in the DB.mv.db and DB.trace.db files.
The used database is every entity class being a table in the database and relations between columns of tables is connected by the class variables.
I believe it is used when entityManagerFactory is called and the relations between classes is created.

* Hibernate:
  create table Customer (
  id bigint generated by default as identity,
  name varchar(255),
  primary key (id)
  )
* Changed false to true on this line in perstistence.xml: property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="true"/
No I did not expect that many tables, but to be fair it has been atleast a year since the last time I worked with relational databases


## Short report

* I did not encounter any technical problems during installation and use of JPA.
